                <p>SpaceX has successfully launched 58 more Starlink satellites for its growing internet broadband
                    constellation. This is
                    the eleventh batch of Starlink satellites to go up, bringing the total on orbit to well over 600.
                    Today’s mission also
                    carried three Planet satellites, and used a Falcon 9 first-stage booster that broke a record by
                    flying for the sixth
                    time.<br />

                    The launch took place at 10:31 AM EDT (7:31 AM PDT) from SpaceX’s launch site at Cape Canaveral Air
                    Force Station in
                    Florida. It also included a recovery attempt for the record-setting reused booster, which performed
                    a sixth landing
                    (also record setting) at sea on SpaceX’s “Of Course I Still Love You” floating drone landing
                    barge.<br /><br />
                    That successful
                    recovery means that the booster can potentially be used yet again, breaking its own record set
                    today.Today’s launch vehicle also used a re-flown fairing, which had been recovered from SpaceX’s
                    fourth Starlink mission and
                    refurbished to use again. Overall, it represents the biggest achievement yet in SpaceX founder and
                    CEO Elon Musk’s goal
                    of eventually being able to fully reuse nearly every aspect of his company’s spacecraft for retreat
                    missions, which
                    should help dramatically reduce the overall cost of rocket flights.<br />

                    As for Starlink, it appears to be progressing well toward SpaceX’s planned beta service launch
                    sometime this year, which
                    will cover parts of the U.S. and Canada. Recently, PCMag reported that Ookla’s Speedtest site for
                    measuring internet
                    connection speeds has been seeing some seemingly legitimate results for Starlink service, which is
                    likely in early
                    (possibly internal only) testing mode using the existing satellites on orbit.<br />

                    The launch today also included a launch recovery attempt, using SpaceX’s “Ms. Chief” and “Ms. Tree”
                    ships at sea. SpaceX
                    noted via Twitter that Ms. Tree did catch one half of the fairing — the other half presumably ended
                    up in the ocean, but
                    could still be retrieved and refurbished.<br />
